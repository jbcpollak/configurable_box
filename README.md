# Configurable Box Generator
A simple box with slip-fit lid generator in OpenSCAD, with configurator enabled.

Use it to generate pencil boxes, soap boxes, a deckbox, any box you need!

## Adjustable Settings

* Internal width, length, and height of both base and lid.
* Outer wall thickness
* Height of the lip (aka "overlap") and ratio of lip to wall thickness
* Radius of the curved edges
* Tolerance

## Example

By default, this project will generate a pencil box like this:
